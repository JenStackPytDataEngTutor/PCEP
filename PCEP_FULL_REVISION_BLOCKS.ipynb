    "# Understanding fundamental concepts\n",
    "1. A language is a means (and a tool) for expressing and recording thoughts.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A natural language is a language people use to communicate with each other in everyday life. English, Russian, German, Swahili, and Hindi are examples of natural languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A programming language is a language developed by humans and used to communicate with computers. A programming language has a set of means to instruct a computer what to do and how.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. A high-level programming language is a programming language which operates on a high level of abstraction thereby allowing the developer to ignore the physical details of the computer's hardware, for example the CPU type, memory size and organization, etc. Python, JavaScript, and C/C++ are all examples of high-level programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. A machine language is a language placed at the lowest level of computer programming. It's a sequence of bits (binary digits usually recognized as 0 and 1) which directly forces the CPU to execute the desired elementary operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. An instruction list (abbreviated to IL) is a list of all elementary (atomic) operations which can be executed by a certain CPU. For example, x86 (used in personal computers) and arm (used in mobile devices) processors have different and incompatible instruction lists).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. A source code is a text encoded in any of the programming languages (regardless of the language's level). Usually, the source code is put inside a text file which resides inside the developer's computer filesystem, while the file name's extension reveals the programming language used to write the code (for example, files with names which ends with .py contain Python source code, while the .cpp extension marks files which hold C++ (usually pronounced as see-plus-plus) source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Any language (no matter if it's natural or artificial) is constituted by:\n",
    "an alphabet understood as a set of symbols used to build words of a certain language (e.g. the Latin alphabet for English, the Cyrillic alphabet for Russian, Kanji for Japanese, and so on).\n",
    "a lexis, also known as a dictionary, is a set of words the language offers its users (for example, the word \"chat\" is present both in English and French dictionaries, but its meaning is obviously different).\n",
    "9. syntax is a set of rules used to determine if a certain sequence of words forms a valid sentence.\n",
    "semantics is defined as a set of rules which settle whether or not a certain phrase or sentence makes sense in a given language.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. A source code cannot be directly executed by a computer. To make it possible the source code has to be translated into a machine code accepted by a target computer and its CPU. This task can be done using two different techniques:\n",
    "compilation performed by a one-time translation of the source program; an executable binary file is created in effect – the file can be run at any time without the need to have the source code; the program that performs the above translation is called a compiler or translator.\n",
    "interpretation which involves a dedicated program designed to translate the source program on-the-fly each time it has to be run; the program performing this task is called an interpreter; this means that the interpreter is needed whenever the source code has to be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. A specific programming language is designed to be the object of either compilation or interpretation (this choice imposes certain distinctive features onto the language). For example, Python is an interpreted programming language, while C++ is a compiled one.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. The interpreter and its environment, created and distributed by the Python Software Foundation (PSF) is written mostly in the C programming language. It allows Python to be easily ported and migrated to all platforms providing the ability to compile and run C language programs. This is also why the PSF implementation is often referred to as CPython. CPython is the most widely used implementation of Python.\n",

    "# Python basic types and literals\n",
    "1. A literal is data whose value is determined by the literal itself. Different kinds of data are coded in different ways, enabling Python (and the human reader of the source code) to determine each literal's type. Knowing each argument's type is crucial to understand what operations are legal, and what results can be returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Integer (int for short) is a type dedicated to storing integral numbers, that is, numbers that lack fractional parts. For example, 1 is an integral number and 1.5 is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Most used integer literals in Python consist of a sequence of decimal digits. Such a sequence cannot include white spaces, but can contain any number of _ (underscore) characters. Note: there must not be more than one underscore between two digits, and the underscore must be neither the last nor the first character of the literal. Underscores don't change a literal's value, and their only role is to improve literal readability. Integer literals can be preceded by any number of - (minus) or + (plus) characters, which are applied to set the literal's sign.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Here are some examples of correct integer literals:\n",
    "        1_111 and 1111 encode the same integer value (one thousand one hundred and eleven)\n",
    "        -+-3 and -3 denote the same integer value (minus three)\n",
    "        +1 and 1 encode the same integer value (one)\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Integer literals may be written using radices other than 10:\n",
    "    if a literal starts with either a 0o or 0O digraph, it's an octal value (note: it must contain octal digits only!)\n",
    "    0o10 encodes an integer value equal to eight.\n",
    "    if a literal starts with either a 0x or 0X digraph, it's a hexadecimal value (note: letters from a to f used as hexadecimal digits may be upper- or lower-case)\n",
    "    0X11 encodes an integer value equal to seventeen.\n",
    "    if a literal starts with either a 0b or 0B digraph, it's a binary value (note: it must contain 0s and 1s only!)\n",
    "    0b111 encodes an integer value equal to seven.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Floating point (float for short) is a type designed to store real numbers (in the mathematical sense), that is, numbers whose decimal expansion is or can be non-zero. Such a class of numbers includes fractions (integers don't).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Float literals are distinguished from integers by the fact that they contain a dot (.) or the letter e (lower- or upper-case) or both. If the only digits which exist before or after the dot are zeros, they can be omitted. Like integers, floats can be preceded by any number of - and + characters, which determine the number's sign. White spaces are not allowed, while underscores are.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. If the float literal contains the letter e, it means that its value is scaled, that is, it's multiplied by a power of 10 while the exponent (which must be an integer!) is placed directly after the letter. A record like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "mEn\n",
    "\n",
    "is treated as a value equal to:\n",
    "\n",
    "m × 10n\n",
